# Adopt me

## About this project

Occasionally I like to go through the entire process of creating a website, from content and design to coding.

This homepage is the result of looking for some inspiration on Dribbble, creating a quick prototype in Figma and finally, turn my idea into reality through HTML, CSS and a bit of Javascript.

## The challenge

Every time I face a new project, I propose to learn something new that I have not done before.

[Adopt me](https://candelaolha.github.io/adopt-me/) was the first website I styled using Sass.

Also, I created a functional slider with Javascript to display "Stories worth reading", which are blog articles.
